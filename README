Catalyst-Plugin-EnhancedParams

This module enhances Catalyst parameter processing support by adding hash (could
also be viewed as object) parameters. It integrates well with Catalyst providing
these hash parameters through the already used C<param()> method of the request 
object but doesn't destroy the original parameter data so it's still somewhat 
L<< CGI >>-compatible.

It further provides helper methods C<param()>, C<parameters()> and its alias 
C<params()> on the Catalyst context namespace so that you can be even lazier 
and just use C<$c->param('field_name')> instead of C<$c->req->param('field_name')>.
